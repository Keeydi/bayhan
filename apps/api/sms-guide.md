## Understanding PhilSMS

### Service Status vs Sender ID Status

**Service ACTIVE** = Your PhilSMS account is working  
**Sender ID ACTIVE** = You can send SMS with that name

These are **two different things**!

## How to Check Your Sender IDs

### Step 1: Login to Dashboard
Go to: https://app.philsms.com

### Step 2: Find Sender ID Section
Look for:
- **"Sender ID"** or **"Sender Registration"**
- **"API"** ‚Üí **"Sender IDs"**
- **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Sender IDs"**

### Step 3: Check Status
You should see a list like:
```
Sender ID: EBay       | Status: ACTIVE ‚úÖ
Sender ID: E-Bayanihan| Status: PENDING ‚è≥
Sender ID: MyApp      | Status: ACTIVE ‚úÖ
```

## Possible Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Sender IDs Listed
**What it means:** You need to register your first sender ID  
**Action:** Register "E-Bayanihan" or any name you prefer  
**Time:** 1-2 business days for approval

### Scenario 2: Sender IDs with ACTIVE Status
**What it means:** You can use these names to send SMS!  
**Action:** Use the exact name in your code  
**Example:** If "EBay" is ACTIVE, use `sender_id: "EBay"`

### Scenario 3: Sender IDs with PENDING Status  
**What it means:** Waiting for PhilSMS approval  
**Action:** Wait for approval email, then test

## What You Need to Tell Me

Please check your dashboard and tell me:

1. **Do you see any sender IDs listed?**
2. **What are their names?** (e.g., "EBay", "E-Bayanihan", etc.)
3. **What is their status?** (ACTIVE/PENDING/REJECTED)

Once I know this, I can:
- Update the code to use the correct sender ID
- Test if SMS works with your approved sender IDs
- Help you register a new one if needed

## Common Sender ID Names Used

If you're not sure what to look for, common patterns are:
- Short names: `EBay`, `BAYAN`, `ERTEAM`
- Company names: `E-BAYANIHAN`, `BAYANIHAN`
- App names: `MyApp`, `EBayApp`, `BayApp`

**Max Length:** 11 characters  
**Allowed:** Letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens

## Quick Test

Once you tell me your sender ID names, I'll test them immediately!

**Reply with:**
```
Sender ID: [name]
Status: [ACTIVE/PENDING/REJECTED]
```

Or just tell me if there are NO sender IDs listed.
